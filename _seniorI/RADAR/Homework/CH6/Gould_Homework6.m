% If you were to design a target to have low specular RCS, how would you proceed?

%% 7 - 1
% Consider a conducting sphere with a radius as of 1 m. What is the RCS of this sphere at an RF
% of 10 GHz? Give the answer in units of both square meters and dBsm. (Assume the sphere is
% “much larger than” the wavelength.) What must be the side length at of a trihedral so that it
% has the same RCS at 10 GHz? What is the ratio of the size of the sphere compared with that of
% the trihedral, as/at ?

o = pi (1) ^2 = pi m^2 

in DBsm 

o = 10 log10(pi) = 4.972dBsm

12pi a_t^4 / lamda^2 = pi =>
