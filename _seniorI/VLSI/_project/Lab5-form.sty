\begin{abstract}
Integrated circuit (IC) layouts are susceptible to errors which can usually only be detected after a sample chip has been created. This report details the verification programs that identify the errors that delay or corrupt IC layouts at a point earlier in the design cycle of a given chip.  These programs compare layout against schematic (LVS) design and extract a theoretical view of the bridge the gap between hypothetical circuit design and application to real layout designs. As such, regarding propagation delay, the developed layout designs produced a smaller propagation delay of a 0.147 \% increase for the inverter design and a comparatively larger difference of 24.5\% decrease of delay for the NAND design. Conclusively, the custom designed, layout-based schematic diagram, after passing appropriate checks, produced a more efficient output to the given circuit design by decreasing propagation delay.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction and Objectives}
Comparison between layout and schematic design ensures that the layout design is functionally equivalent to the circuit design of the logic in question. In this lab, the extracted visual design and circuit netlist is compared. Using DivaEXT to extract netlists, the next verification step is to pass the Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) process and check the circuit functions through simulations with the extracted netlist.

\section{Background and Relevant Theory}
\label{sec:background}

\subsection{NOT Gate}
\label{sec:NOT}

Also known as an inverter, the NOT gate inverts the state of the input signal to the opposite state. The NOT gate is the most basic design for CMOS logic, displaying the NMOS and PMOS pairing characteristics. With an input (A) at ground value of 0, the inverter PMOS transistor in the NOT circuit pulls the source voltage of the output (Y) pin to high. With input at a high value of 1, the NMOS pulls down the output to 0. Physically, the NOT gate represents a CMOS logic ratio of 2:1 with the PMOS layout design being larger at the p+ diffusion layer.

\subsection{NAND Gate}
%   EDIT    %   EDIT    %   EDIT    %
 Transistors in NAND gate have equal size. This is illustrated in the width and length of the NMOS and PMOS of Figure \ref{fig:nand-circ}. With a 2-input NAND gate, Here, the output is pulled low only when both of the inputs labelled A and B are both turned high. NAND circuits produce a $\frac{4}{3}$ logical effort to the design[1]. As such, the logical effort of the system proportially applies to the size of the system. Naturally, the delay in a NAND system is higher than the delay of a NOT circuit as due to the larger CMOS devices. This trend goes into a larger explanation in Section \ref{sec:delay}.
\subsection{CMOS Layout Architecture}

CMOS architecture and layout design can be constructed using the layers of conductive and insulating composition. The layers used in this design for all models are listed in Table \ref{table:layerdesc} along with the purpose of each layer. Understanding the overview of layout components allow for the layout designs of the NAND and NOT circuit to develop trends in delay reduction at the component level.

\end{table}

\subsection{Layout Extraction}
\label{sec:Extraction}

Circuit extraction is the configuration of an integrated circuit layout translated into an electrical circuit of intended similar design[1]. The extracted circuit is required for circuit simulation, optimization, and logic to layout comparison. 

\subsection{Design Rules}
The custom integrated chip (IC) layout for the CMOS logic design represents the layered masks used to fabricate a single component of a silicon wafer. The main objectives of the layout design are to build circuits in a reliably compact area.  Design rules are defined regarding layer separations, feature sizes, and overlaps based in lambda-based design rules[1]. Lambda ($\lambda$) describes resolution of the design process as a unit. Total verification of a chip involves the design rule check (DRC) and layout versus schematic (LVS) along with a few other checks. For this experiment, each layout was run under both design checks to properly verify each design for the NOT and NAND circuits. Design rules represent a compromise between chip performance and electrical yield with stronger rules producing greater opportunity for circuit improvements[1].

\label{sec:designrules}

\subsection{Delay}
Delay within an inverter system can be measured to show the imperfections set by a transistor used in a design or the elements surrounding the transistor. For this report, delay characteristics of concern are the rise time, fall time, and propagation delay.

\begin{align}
    d = gh + p
    \label{eq:delay}
\end{align}

Additionally, Equation \ref{eq:delay} references the delay of the gate of a single logic gate along with the components attached to it. This equation, with $g$ being the logical effort, $h$ being the electrical effort, and $p$ being the parasitic delay, measures the total delay of a certain CMOS logic system. Simply, the equation provides a trend to improve the delay of a system's performance based on gate type.
\label{sec:delay}
\subsection{Rise \& Fall Time}
Rise time and fall time is the time between 20\% and the 80\% of the total transfer curve values. Specifically, rise time is the difference of time between the 20\% of the total value to 80\% of the total value. In this example, Equation\ref{eq:tf} and Equation \ref{eq:tr} refers to these properties measured on the input and output signal[1].

\begin{align}
    t_f = |t_{VDD@80\%} - t_{VDD@20\%}|
    \label{eq:tf}\\
    t_r = | t_{VDD@20\%} - t_{VDD@80\%}|
    \label{eq:tr}
\end{align}
\subsection{Propagation Delay}
Propagation delay refers to the maximum time from the input crossing signal at 50\% to the output crossing signal at 50\%. The average of the values at the rise and fall of the input and output signal is the propagation delay ($t_{pd}$) represented by Equation \ref{eq:tpd}[1].

\begin{align}
\frac{t_{pdf} + t_{pdr }}{2}
    \label{eq:tpd}
\end{align}

Propagation delay is the greater obstacle in the area of IC development and can effectively bottleneck systems. Reducing propagation delay decreases the length of time for the input to become reactive and stable to change. 

\section{Procedure}
Cadence Layout Design software was used to develop the layout circuit design process and checking system. As a start, an inverter was created in the Cadence software. Layout designs used ran through a DRC check and the LVS check against a previously designed circuit, matching netlists. The layout was extracted and generated on a separate symbol schematic in order to compare the inverter layout against the pre-simulated circuit design built into cadence. This process was repeated for a NAND logic circuit. Delay relating to propagation, rise time, and fall time was measured at the appropriate junctures in order to compare the graphical simulations at each point.

\subsection{Inverter Layout}
The custom inverter layout represents the CMOS masks used in wafers to fabricate a small part of the IC chips. The layout design provided in Figure \ref{fig:inv-layout} processes the layers detailed in Section \ref{sec:Layout-desc} color-coded with an implemented input pin provided at the poly layer in the middle of the design.

Notably, Figure \ref{fig:inv-layout} includes the total size of the CMOS inverter design at 14.4$\lambda$ by 7.2$\lambda$. This total schematic design plays a role in the delay and cost of the overall design as detailed in Section \ref{sec:designrules} \& \ref{sec:delay}.   Improvements based on the framework of this design are explained in Section \ref{sec:compare-inv}.

As such, modelled by the in-out pins labeled appropriately "in" and "out" at the ends of the schematic of  Figure \ref{fig:inv-sym} correspond to the vdd and gnd terminal pins at the top and bottom of the inverter layout of Figure \ref{fig:inv-layout}.

\label{table:perc-diff-inv}
\end{table}

Of interest to delay prospects, the inverter design output produced by the layout of Figure \ref{fig:inv-layout} should process a lower propagation delay where a shorter amount of time between input and output allows for a decreased system switch time and increased system stability. As such the absolute value of percent difference to the two systems show that the propagation delay of the layout design improved in performance allowing to make assumptions that the overall design of Figure \ref{fig:inv-layout} to be said to have improved the IC. However, it is of note that the rise time of the system increased for the layout design which notably delays the system from an 'off' to 'on' state. This design specification is applied to the PMOS device as the PMOS device pulls the inverter to Vdd. The system capacitance at the PMOS device should be decreased in order to improve this characteristic.

\subsection{NAND Layout}
\label{sec:nand-layout}

Figure \ref{fig:nand_layout} includes the pinout label of the CMOS inverter design at a size of 18.9$\lambda$ by 9.6$\lambda$. This total schematic design plays a role in the delay and cost of the overall design as detailed in Section \ref{sec:designrules} and \ref{sec:delay}.   Improvements based on the framework of this design are explained in Section \ref{sec:compare-nand}.

Section \ref{sec:NAND-circ} displays with Figure \ref{fig:nand-circ} that the design NAND circuit elements followed a CMOS size-ratio of 2:2 along with the layout design provided below. This schematic is referenced with Figure \ref{fig:nand_layout} to meet LVS design requirements and cross-check the netlist elements on each work.

\end{table}

The NAND design output, similar to the NOT gate,  produced by the layout of Figure \ref{fig:nand_layout} processes a lower propagation delay where a shorter amount of time between input and output allows for a decreased system switch time and increased system stability. As such the absolute value of percent difference to the two systems show that the propagation delay of the layout design improved in performance allowing to make assumptions that the overall design of Figure \ref{fig:nand_layout} to be said to have improved the IC. Unlike the inverter however, the NAND design improved on all fronts, for time rise, fall, and propagation by a larger margin than the inverter. System improvements could be performed on reducing the distance between diffusion layers of the layout and the overall surface area.

\section{Conclusions}

In this experiment, layout design versus schematic design was implemented through the Cadence medium to perform a DRC and LVS check of each gate CMOS system. The NOT and NAND layouts created a visual to show the surface area of the chip that relates to the system delay and time propagation. DRC results of the layout circuit design, similar in given design rules, produced no errors. LVS results produced an output that states that the netlists matched. This verifies that the layouts followed design rules and are properly matching the circuit designs. The layout designs additionally improved the delay on the CMOS system displaying that system improvements can be found in layout modification and rule checking.
