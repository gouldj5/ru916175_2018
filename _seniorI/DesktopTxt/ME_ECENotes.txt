Chapter 3: The effects of forces on materials
3.1 - Force 

can cause either a change in shape or motion of a body

force[N] newtons		f --> --> a

NO solid body is perfectly rigid
Ex: bridge span will sag
    wrench will bend when tightening nut

   forces: (3 types)
	1. tensile
	2. compressive
	3. shear

3.2 Tensile force - tends to stretch material

	F <-- [=====]--> F
	
	i)   role or cable are in tension
	ii)  rubber band in tension when stretched
	iii) bolt under tension when nut is tightened

3.3 Compressive Force - tends to squeeze or crush material

	F --> [=====] <-- F

	i)   pillar supporting bridge
	ii)  sole of shoe
	iii) jib of crane

3.4 Shear Force - tends to slide one face of material over adjacent face

	F <--[====|=] 
	   	[=|====]-->F

	i)   rivet is a shear
	ii)  guillotine cutting metal
	iii) a horizontal beam
	iv)  transmission joints

3.5 Stress force neting on a material causing a change in demension

stress ratio of F to cross sectional area A

o = F/A [Pa] - Pascal N/m^2 
^for tension and compression

T-tau = F/A < for sheer stress

Rectangular bar having cross-sectional area of 75mm^2 has tensile force of 15kN applied. 
Determine stress in bar.

given: 	A = 75 mm^2
	F = 15 kN
find: stress,m o = ?
equation: 
	o = F/A = 75 mm^2/15 kN
	o = 200,000 Pa

3.6 Strain - fractional change in demension of material when a force is applied

	tension or compression strain:
	 
	E(episilon) = x/L	F <--[__L__]-x-]->
		x - change in length
		L - original length 

	shear strain:

	\o/(gamma)= x/L

strain is expressed as a percentage

Ex: 
Given:	10mm
	20mPa
	3kN
find breadth
equation: 
	o = F/A = f/wb -> b = F /wo

3.7 Elasticity, limit of proportionality, elastic limit

Elasticity - ability of material to return
plasticity - property of material being permanently deformed

....

3.8 Hooke's Law - within the limit of proportionality the extension of a material is proportional to the applied force
