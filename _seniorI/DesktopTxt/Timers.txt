Timers:
Counts

3 behaviors that these timers exhibit

> 16 bit timer, continuous mode, continue until 0xFFFF   
> 16 bit timer, defined limit, continue until 0x(set number) Up mode
> Up/Down mode

Where does the clk come from the board?
Aclk			Clock divider sits between
MClk			MUX and MSP430
SMClk			
USBClk
 
Interupts are better than pull
Interupts must be enabled > better on CPU but can run into conflicts

CCR ( Capture and Compare Register) - 16 bit registers
CCR0, CCR1, CCR2 - sets when timer resets
Captures different points
1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 Mask it (AND) to find point

add case 8 for both CCRs going off
