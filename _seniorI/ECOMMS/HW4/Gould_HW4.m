%% Problem 1 
% A  Pulse  code  modulation  (PCM)  signal  is  a  binary  signal.  The
% digital  PCM  is  converted  from  an analog s ignal. The bandwidth of
% the analog signal is 1kHz. To convert the analog signal to the digital
% signal, the voltage of each sampling point is divided into 8 levels. (a)
% What is the baud (symbol rate) for this PCM signal? (b) What is the bit
% rate for this PCM signal? (c) What  is  the  minimum  bandwidth  for  a
% communication  system  to  transmit  this  PCM  signal (in unit of kHz)?
%% Problem 2 - Textbook 3-21
% A  multilevel  digital  communication  system  sends  one  of  16
% possible  levels  over  the  channel  every 0.8ms (a) What is the numbe r
% of bits corresponding to each level ? Or in another word, how many bits
% in each symbol? Note that the levels in this problem are different from
% the levels in the last problem.  In  the  last  problem,  levels  are
% from  analog  to  digital  conversion,  while  in  thi s problem, the
% digital signal itself is a multilevel signal. (b) What is the baud
% (symbol rate)? (c) What is he bit rate?
%% Problem 3 
% The input of a differential coding signal is 10110010.
% Begin with the % reference digit “1”, what is the en coded sequence? In your solution,
% please label, which digit is reference digit, which digits are encoded
% sequence.
